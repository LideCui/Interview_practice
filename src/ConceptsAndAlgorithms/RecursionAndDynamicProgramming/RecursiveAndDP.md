### Recursion
Recursive solutions are built off of solutions to sub-problems. 
#### Bottom up Approach
Think how to build the problem from one case and previous cases.

#### Top down approach
Thinkn how we can divide the problem for case N into sub-problems.

#### Half and half approach
divide the data into half. 

Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient for it adds new layers to the
stack. 

### Dynamic Programming
It is basically taking a recursive algorithm and finding the overlapping 
sub-problems. You can cache these results for future recursive calls. 

Tip: Drawing the recursive calls as a tree is a great way to figure out the 
runtime of a recursive algorithm.
